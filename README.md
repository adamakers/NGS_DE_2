# NGS_DE_2
A rethinking of the National Geodetic Survey Data Explorer.

The goal of this project is to recreate a easier version of site and make it more user friendly.

I would like to add features such as point filtering and being able to export all selected or available points to a KML output.

Eventually, after learning backend, I would like to be able to create a KML download of the points.
